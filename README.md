# Alternate-Routes
### Project Description:
Designed a multi-page web application offering two routes - a root route and an alternate route. The root route loads up a calculator that accepts two operands and an operator. On the other hand, the alternate route loads up a BMI calculator that accepts a user's weight and height. An evaluation of the expressions provided, by either of the routes, is done on the server side with the home route offering the result of the operation and the alternate route offering an interpration of the user's BMI status.
### External node modules used:
- express
- body-parser
### Languages and technologies:
- HTML5
- JavaScript ES6
- Unix Command Line
- Node.js
- Express.js
### Purpose:
This project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in building multi-page web applications using the Express.js framework. It showcases my understanding of routing, server-side evaluation of mathematical expressions and the use of external modules such as “express” and “body-parser”. The project consists of two routes, a root route that loads a calculator that accepts two operands and an operator, and an alternate route that loads a BMI calculator that accepts a user’s weight and height. The server-side evaluation is done on the root route that offers the result of the operation and the alternate route that offers an interpretation of the user’s BMI status. This project also showcases my proficiency in HTML5, JavaScript ES6 and my understanding of how to interact with the command line interface to execute the application and view the results.

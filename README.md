# Alternate-Routes
### Project Description:
Designed a multi-page web application offering two routes - a root route and an alternate route. The root route loads up a calculator that accepts two operands and an operator. On the other hand, the alternate route loads up a BMI calculator that accepts a user's weight and height. An evaluation of the expressions provided, by either of the routes, is done on the server side with the home route offering the result of the operation and the alternate route offering an interpration of the user's BMI status.

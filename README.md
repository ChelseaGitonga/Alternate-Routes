# Alternate-Routes
## Project Description: Designed a multi-page website offering two routes – a root route and an alternate route. The root route launches a Calculator that accepts two operands and an operator. On the other hand, the alternate route launches a BMI calculator that accepts a user’s weight and height. Execution of the expressions provided, by either of the routes, is carried out on the server side with one route offering the result of an operation and the other offering an interpretation of the user’s BMI status.
